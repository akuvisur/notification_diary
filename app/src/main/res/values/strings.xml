"This application logs the notifications you receive on your device. You are then asked to specify the importance of the notification CONTENTS and whether the notification was presented at an appropriate TIME for you.\r\n
This is performed for all notifications that you have DISMISSED (swiped). All notifications you CLICK are assumed to be of importance to you.\r\n
Based on this information, the application will attempt to manage the notifications you receive by hiding notifications that do not contain importance information or are otherwise unwanted.

"In the DIARY view, you will see the notifications you have received, and the contents and source application of the notification.\r\n
Please select on the 1-5 scale (1 = low, 5 = high) the IMPORTANCE and the TIMING of the notification at the time when you interacted (DISMISSED or CLICKED) with it.\r\n
If you can not remember, or are otherwise unsure, please select the UNSURE option instead of inputting a random number on the scale.\r\n
Then select NEXT to proceed to the next notification, or select SKIP if you do not wish to label a notification. You will not be asked to label skipped notifications again.

"Based on the labels you have given to each notification, the application will, over time, learn of your notification preferences and attempt to make predictions on what type of content and notifications you prefer.\r\n
After you have labeled the requisite amount of information and the overall predictions are accurate enough (you will see this progress on the predictions page), you are able to ENABLE PREDICTIONS.\r\n
The predictions use machine learning to predict whether a notification should be shown or hidden.\r\n
After the predictions are ENABLED, the notifications hidden by the application will be shown in the predictions tab, and you can give further validation that the items were either correctly or incorrectly hidden.
